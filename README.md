# About me

## This is my first year in college
## My Interests: I'm interested in learning ASL. I enjoy cooking in my free time. Most of my time is spent with my family. Games I enjoy are Minecraft, Super Mario Party, and Word Searches. I love fantasy novels and television. I also enjoy comedies.

## Websites I recommend:
 * [Flight Tracker](https://www.flightradar24.com/G20926) - This one is cool because you can see live feed of any flying vehicles.
 * [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) - I like Pinterest because it allows me to make inspiration boards for my creative ideas.
